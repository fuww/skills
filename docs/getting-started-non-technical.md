## What Are Claude Skills?

Skills are like "superpowers" you can give Claude to help with specific tasks. Instead of explaining what you need every time, skills teach Claude your preferred workflows, brand guidelines, and best practices automatically.

**Think of it like this:** Instead of telling a new colleague "use our rose color #ea0151 and Helvetica Neue font" every time, you train them once and they remember forever.

## Quick Tips

1. **Be specific** - "Use copywriting to make this headline more urgent" works better than "improve this"

2. **Combine skills** - You can use multiple skills in one conversation:
   > "Use seo-audit to check this blog post, then use copywriting to fix any issues"

3. **Ask for explanations** - Skills will explain their suggestions if you ask

4. **Iterate** - Not happy with the first result? Just say "try again with a more casual tone"
