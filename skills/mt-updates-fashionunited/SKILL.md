# MT Updates Skill

## Overview

This skill helps write monthly internal email updates from the Management Team (MT) to all FashionUnited employees. Each update communicates company news, metrics, milestones, and announcements in a "Playful Business" tone that reflects FashionUnited's position in the fashion industry.

**Use this skill when:**
- Writing the monthly MT update email
- Communicating company-wide announcements from leadership
- Sharing metrics, milestones, or team news internally

**Output:** Two email versions for the MT to choose from:
1. **Busy Bee** - Scannable bullets and bold headings
2. **Storyteller** - Flowing narrative that connects the dots

## Tone: "Playful Business"

The "Playful Business" tone combines professional communication with conversational warmth and fashion-forward language. It's the written equivalent of smart-casual dress code: polished but approachable.

### DO

- Use fashion industry terminology naturally ("runway," "collection," "lookbook," "curated")
- Write conversationally, as if speaking to colleagues at a team lunch
- Include light touches of humor or wordplay when appropriate
- Use active voice and direct address ("you," "we," "our team")
- Keep sentences punchy and varied in length
- Celebrate wins with genuine enthusiasm (without exclamation points)

### DON'T

- Use emojis - ever (strict constraint)
- Use exclamation points excessively (maximum one per email, if any)
- Sound corporate or bureaucratic ("per our discussion," "going forward," "synergies")
- Be overly casual or use slang
- Use buzzwords or jargon from other industries
- Write in passive voice ("it was decided that...")

### Tone Examples

**Instead of:** "Q4 revenue targets were exceeded by 15%."
**Write:** "We wrapped Q4 with numbers that made us do a double-take - 15% above target."

**Instead of:** "We are pleased to announce a new hire in the editorial department."
**Write:** "Our editorial team just got a fresh addition to the roster."

**Instead of:** "Please be advised of the upcoming holiday schedule."
**Write:** "Quick heads-up on the holiday calendar so you can plan accordingly."

## Workflow

When using this skill, follow these steps:

### 1. Analyze Input

Review the provided content for:
- Specific metrics and numbers
- Named individuals or teams
- Dates and timelines
- Context for any changes or announcements

### 2. Ask Clarifying Questions

If any input is vague or incomplete, ask before writing. Common clarifications needed:

| Vague Input | Clarification to Ask |
|-------------|---------------------|
| "Traffic up" | By what percentage? Compared to when? |
| "New hire" | Name, role, team, start date? |
| "Inflation" | Current rate? Impact on FashionUnited specifically? |
| "Good quarter" | Which metrics? Revenue, traffic, engagement? |
| "Event coming up" | Date, location, who's invited? |
| "Product launch" | Which product? Launch date? |

### 3. Generate Two Versions

Always produce both formats so the MT can choose based on the month's content and their preference.

## Output Formats

### Format 1: Busy Bee

For readers who scan. Uses bullet points, bold keywords, and clear sections.

```
Subject: [Month] MT Update: [Key Highlight]

Hi team,

[One-sentence opener that sets the tone]

**The Numbers**
- [Metric]: [Value] ([context])
- [Metric]: [Value] ([context])

**Team News**
- [Update about people, hires, promotions]

**On the Calendar**
- [Date]: [Event or milestone]

**Looking Ahead**
- [Brief forward-looking statement]

[One-sentence closer]

[MT signature]
```

### Format 2: Storyteller

For readers who prefer narrative. Connects updates into a cohesive story.

```
Subject: [Month] MT Update: [Key Highlight]

Hi team,

[Opening paragraph: 2-3 sentences that frame the month's theme or feeling]

[Body paragraph 1: Numbers and metrics woven into context - what they mean for us]

[Body paragraph 2: Team and people updates - celebrating contributions]

[Body paragraph 3: What's ahead - connecting current progress to future goals]

[Closing: 1-2 sentences that reinforce team spirit or key takeaway]

[MT signature]
```

## Fashion Vocabulary

Incorporate these naturally when relevant:

### Industry Terms
- Runway, collection, lookbook

## Words and Phrases to Avoid

| Avoid | Why | Alternative |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| Synergy | Corporate cliche | "Working together" or "teaming up" |
| Going forward | Stiff | "From here" or "next" |
| Per our discussion | Formal | "As we talked about" |
| Please be advised | Cold | "Quick heads-up" or "Just so you know" |
| At this time | Bureaucratic | "Right now" or "currently" |
| Leverage | Overused | "Use" or "tap into" |
| Circle back | Corporate speak | "Revisit" or "come back to" |
| Touch base | Dated | "Check in" or "catch up" |
| Bandwidth | Tech jargon | "Time" or "capacity" |

## Length Guidelines

- **Target:** Under 300 words
- **Reading time:** 1-2 minutes maximum
- **Paragraphs:** 2-4 sentences each
- **Bullets:** 3-6 items in any list

Employees are busy. Respect their time. If an update requires more detail, link to a separate document rather than extending the email.

## Subject Line Formula

`[Month] MT Update: [One Key Highlight]`

Examples:
- "November MT Update: Traffic Hits Record High"
- "December MT Update: Year in Review"
- "January MT Update: New Faces, New Goals"

Keep the highlight specific and intriguing - it should make someone want to open the email.
